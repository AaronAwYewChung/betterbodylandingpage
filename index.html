          <h1>Ageing Gracefully Shouldn’t Be This Hard!</h1>
          <p>
            The subtle signs of aging skin can catch many ladies by surprise.
            Oftentimes, ladies only start to take their skincare routine more
            seriously after spotting their first wrinkle.
          </p>
          <p>
            By then the skin damage has already begun… and menopause amplifies
            the effects.
          </p>
          <p>
            The decline in estrogen levels can lead to a whole range of
            skin-related issues such as:

            The Science Behind Menopausal Skin Issues - Why Some Ladies Look
            Older Than They Actually Are
          </h1>
          <p>
            The skin is made up of 3 main layers & the health of each layer
            impacts the overall look and feel of our skin.
          </p>
          <p>
            During menopause, the fluctuating estrogen levels causes each layer
            to deteriorate over time:

          <h1>Dry Skin, Dark Spots & Fine Lines? Blame The Epidermis</h1>
          <p>
            Common Skin Issues Caused: <b> “Age spots” & Dry, flakey skin</b>
          </p>
          <p>Why Does It Happen?</p>
          <p>
            Age spots” are caused by prolonged exposure to UV light from the sun
            - which may cause Vitamin E (a natural UV skin protector) levels to
            decrease.
          </p>
          <p>
            UV light may also increase the free radicals (cell-destroyers) in
            the skin’s epidermis level. This may lead to dryness and flaking as
            we age
          </p>

          <p>
            Low hyaluronic acid levels is another big issue that causes dryness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hyaluronic acid is a naturally-occurring substance in the skin
            that’s known for it’s amazing capacity to hold onto 1000x its weight
            in moisture.
          </p>
          <p>Simply put, it is what keeps the skin bouncy and supple.</p>
          <p>
            The bad news is that research suggests that hyaluronic acid levels
            decline over time… causing the skin to look pale and dry as years
            pass.

          <h1>Deep Sagging & Wrinkles? It’s Likely Your Dermis...</h1>
          <p>Common Skin Issues Caused: “Age spots” & Dry, flakey skin</p>
          <p>Why Does It Happen?</p>
          <p>
            Wrinkles and sagging skin are a result of 2 factors in the dermis
            layer:
          </p>
          <img
            src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2060/5733/t/23/assets/infographic_5.jpg?v=1587482310"

          <p>1. Low collagen levels</p>
          <p>
            If the skin was a mattress, collagen are the springs that are
            holding it up. The higher the number of springs, the more even the
            surface of the mattress.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, as we age, collagen levels drop… which leads to lesser
            support to hold up the skin.
          </p>
          <p>2. High glycation levels</p>

          <p>Glycation is one of the main causes of skin aging.</p>

          <p>
            It occurs when excess sugar we ingest reacts with collagen - and
            binds to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s like rust coating the springs (collagen) in the mattress
            (skin), and over time, the springs get destroyed — leading to uneven
            support for the skin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Low collagen and high glycation collectively lead to deep wrinkles
            and sagging skin as we age.
